\section{Conclusions}

We have formally defined Hybrid Consensus protocol and its implementation along with plausible speculations in the original
proposal as well as implementation specifications. In this draft of paper, we have introduced various new concepts
some of which we will detail in the next version very soon. We recommend people to choose ASIC resistant hardware for
deployment of the POW only versus full nodes, although more details on hardware shall follow soon.
