\section{Background}

The core strength of this proposal lies in the recognition of the theorems proposed in the Hybrid protocol\cite{pass2017hybrid}
by Rafael and Elaine. We benefit from the fact that there is a lot of design space for further optimizations in that paper.
The use of DailyBFT as committee members allows for the rotating committee feature which provides for better fairness for
the consensus validating peers.

The POW nodes could benefit from incentivization infrastructure while they're also a part of the slower snailchain, helping
deploy smart contracts and validations but mostly catching up with the fast chain time to time.

\subsection{Related Works}

Hybrid Consensus follows a design paradigm where BFT and PoW are combined together so that it enjoys nice properties
from both of the world. In general, Hybrid Consensus will utilize BFT protocols, which by default works in a permissioned
setting where all the identities are known before the protocol starts, as a fast path dealing with large amount of incoming
transactions, and PoW protocols with $\mathsf{stake\_in}$ / $\mathsf{stake\_out}$ (with random selection) acting as the barebone of the protocol which
supports BFT to deal with dynamic membership and committee switching in the permissionless setting.
