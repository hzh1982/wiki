\section{Future Direction}

Even after optimizations to the original Hybrid Consensus, we acknowledge various optimizations possible on top of what was
proposed in this paper. There's possibility of:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Improving timestamp synchronization for all nodes, with no dependency on centralized NTP servers.
  \item Detailed incentivization techniques for compensation infrastructure, so heavy infrastructure investors don't suffer from 'left-out', 'at a loss' problem
  \item Sharding techniques with replica creation to minimize the transaction set rejection from the BFT committee.
  \item Addition of zero knowledge proof techniques for privacy.
  \item Hybrid infrastructure of EVM, TVM and Linux container ecosystem.
  \item Sections for Virtual Machine Specification, Binary Data Encoding Method, Signing Transactions, Fee Schedule and Ethash Alternative.
\end{itemize}
